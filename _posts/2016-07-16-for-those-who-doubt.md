For those who doubt. 

For those from rich or poor. 

For those who sit in their rooms as social recluses during high school. 

For the hopeless romantics. 

For the unknowingly majorly depressed. 

For the self deprecators. 

For the worry stricken over thinkers. 

For those who hope for more. 

For the exploited, the degraded and self-confidence lacking. 

For the "unattractive", substandardised and apparently socially inept. 

For the secretive thinkers, world changers and heroes and heroines among us. 

This is for you. 

You are more than what society tries to force you to be. You are here to crash the system. Tear it to pieces, make it your own. Innovate, create and conquer. You will find the right help. You will find the right love. You will not fight the world with revenge or aggression, but with philanthropic principles. You will bring about the change that the conformists simply cannot. 

You'll attack hatred with love and compassion. You'll innovate and explore and break stigmas in the world. 

You'll be those in the history books as creators of our future. 

The biggest changes on earth will come from your mind, because you've had the most time to dive into the realms of psyche that no one else dare. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b2365609-ea1e-45cf-a3cf-6cace21ff60f.jpg)

You will live to create.
